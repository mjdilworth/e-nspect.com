		<DIV class="mytext">Fr8Tools is a suite of Excel add-ins and analytics libraries 
			specifically designed for freight derivatives and shipping risk management.</DIV>
		<DIV class="syntax">What makes Fr8Tools unique is the fact that it is tailored to 
			the exact characteristics of freight derivatives, with metrics which can be 
			directly related to the underlying business (e.g. delta expressed in number of 
			ship days or number of ships). In addition, Fr8Tools can be offered 
			(optionally) together with a dedicated data service which provides 
			pre-calculated input parameters for direct import into the system. Hence, we 
			minimise the requirements for manual data entry by the user and improve 
			productivity and speed of calculations.</p>
			<p class="arial">
			The first module which is currently offered as part of the Fr8Tools suite of 
			products is the Fr8Option module. This is specifically designed to offer a wide 
			range of calculations relating to freight options, such as fair value, implied 
			volatility, historical volatility, Greeks, etc. Furthermore, Fr8Options 
			includes a complete set of Excel functions and workbook solutions for forward 
			curve building. A unique feature of Fr8Option is the pricing model which has 
			been developed by FreightMetrics for pricing freight options more accurately by 
			simulating off the full forward curve of freight rates.</DIV>
