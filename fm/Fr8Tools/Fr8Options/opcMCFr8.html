				<b>INPUT PARAMETERS:-</b>
				<p></p>
				<b>Selecting the model type:</b> An option pricing model is a mathematical 
				formula which takes current market factors as inputs and calculates an option's 
				theoretical fair market value and associated risk parameters called 'Greeks'. 
				This calculator contains three option models; FreightMetrics' MonteCarlo(Fr8), 
				MonteCarlo(Generic), and Turnbull&Wakeman. Each model has its own methodology 
				and further information on the models can be found from reference material.
				<p>
					<b>Value Date:</b>
				The system automatically inputs today's date.
				<p>
					<b>Selecting the underlying index:</b>
				The underlying is the asset or instrument on which an options payoff is based. 
				The user must choose the appropriate index or route from the drop down menu.
				<p>
					<b>Period:</b>
				The user must select the appropriate contract from the drop down menu.
				<p>
					<b>Avg.period start / Avg.period end:</b>
				The system automatically generates the calendar dates of the chosen contract as 
				an aid to the user.
				<p>
					<b>Call / Put:</b>
				The user must select whether the fair market value calculation will be for a 
				Call or a Put option.
				<p>
					<b>Strike: </b>
				The strike price is the price at which an option permits its owner to buy or 
				sell the underlying asset.
				<p>
					<b>Volatility (%):</b>
				In simple terms volatility is a measure of momentum in a market. Markets that 
				move slowly are low-volatility markets; markets that move quickly are 
				high-volatility markets.
				<p>
					<b>Risk-free rate (%):</b>
				The interest rate is the current risk-free interest rate, often described as 
				the rate the Federal Reserve Bank charges banks to borrow money (i.e. Fed Funds 
				Rate).
				<p>
					<b>Quantity: </b>
				Here the user can manually input the number of days, or tonnes, of the contract 
				that will be calculated. Ticking the 'Full' box will instruct the system to 
				input the full number of 'contract days', or 'tonnes', for the chosen contract.
				<p>
					<b>Flat Rate: </b>
				Here the system automatically fills the applicable flat rate to convert 
				Worldscale rates to $/tonne.
				<p>
					<b>Simulation runs:</b>
				Here the user has the ability to choose the number of simulated runs for both 
				the FreightMetrics MonteCarlo (Fr8) and the Montecarlo (Generic) models. 
				Calculations involving many 'runs' leads to more accurate pricing but requires 
				longer computational time.

				<!--INTRO_TEXT-->
				<b>OUTPUT PARAMETERS:-</b> 
				<!--INTRO_TEXT_END-->
				<p>
				Output given by the system represents the theoretical 'fair market value' price 
				of the option and option risk parameters called "Greeks". The "Greeks" are used 
				to gauge how different movements in the market will affect the price of the 
				option.
				<p>
					<b>Option price and the 'Greeks'</b>
				<p>
					<b>Output Statistic:</b>
				Here the user has the ability to choose from the drop down menu the output as 
				Price, Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, or Rho.
				<p>
					<b>Price:</b>
				The theoretical fair market value of the option, which is used to determine if 
				arbitrage opportunities exist in the market place by checking if actual option 
				values are trading over or under the fair market value.
				<p>
					<b>Delta:</b>
				The ratio of the change in an option’s price to a given change in the price of 
				the underlying asset or instrument. If the underlying changed by a given amount 
				the option price would change by a fraction (the delta) of that amount.
				<p>
					<b>Gamma:</b>
				The rate of change of an option’s delta with respect to a change in the price 
				of the underlying assets or instrument. If the underlying changed by a given 
				amount the option delta would change by a fraction (the gamma) of that amount.
				<p>
					<b>Theta:</b>
				The rate of change of an option’s price with respect to time. It is a measure 
				of the erosion in the time value of the option as it moves closer to expiration
				<p>
					<b>Vega:</b>
				The rate of change of an option’s price with respect to the change in the 
				volatility of the underlying asset or future.
				<p>
					<b>Rho:</b>
				The rate of change of an option’s price with respect to the change in the 
				risk-free interest rate.
				<p>
					<b>Price expression: </b>
				Here the user has the ability to choose the way the option's 'price' is 
				expressed from the drop down menu in terms of 'Rate' ($/day or $/tonne or WS) or 'Amount' 
				($).
				<p>
					<b>Delta expression:</b>
				Here the user has the ability to choose the way the option's 'delta' is 
				expressed from the drop down menu in terms of "Contracts" (or equivalent ships) or "Quantity" (calendar days or metric tonnes).
				<p>
					<b>'Keep previous random numbers':</b>
				For MonteCarlo models only. Ticking this box instructs the system to keep the 
				numbers randomly generated from the current simulation so that the user can 
				change various parameters and compare output statistics.

				<!--INTRO_TEXT-->
				<b>TERMINAL PAYOFF:-</b> 
				<!--INTRO_TEXT_END-->
				<p>
					<b>Buy/Sell: </b>By selecting <u>Buy</u> or <u>Sell</u>
				from the drop down menu the user has the ability to view diagramatically the 
				'terminal payoff' when buying or selling a particular option.
				<p>
					<b>Settlement range:</b>
				Allows the user to adjust the x-axis parameters of the 'payoff diagram'.
				<p>
				<p>
					<b>For FreightMetrics MonteCarlo (Fr8) model only.</b>
				<p>
					<b>Forward curve:</b>
				Here the user is required to generate the forward curve using the data manager 
				from the forward curve builder before using the FreightMetrics MonteCarlo (Fr8) 
				model.
